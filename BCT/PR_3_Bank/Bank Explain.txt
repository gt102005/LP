🔍 Step 1: What Blockchain Is (Concept Overview)

Before we dive into the code, let’s recall what blockchain technology means:

Concept	Description
Blockchain	A distributed, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively.
Smart Contracts	Programs stored on the blockchain that run when predefined conditions are met (written in Solidity on Ethereum).
Ethereum	A blockchain platform that supports programmable contracts (smart contracts) and decentralized applications (DApps).
Solidity	The programming language used to write Ethereum smart contracts.
Gas	The fee users pay to execute operations or deploy smart contracts.
⚙️ Step 2: Let’s Read Your Code (Bank.sol)

I’ll now read the Solidity code you uploaded and then explain it line-by-line.

Analyzed

Here’s the complete explanation of your Solidity smart contract Bank.sol — both code-wise and conceptually (blockchain behavior):

🧩 Code: Bank.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.30;

contract Bank {
    uint256 private balance;
    address public accOwner;

    constructor() payable {
        accOwner = msg.sender;
        balance = msg.value;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not the account owner");
        require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount should be greater than 0");
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");

        balance -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    function showBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not the account owner");
        return balance;
    }

    receive() external payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }
}

🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation
1. License and Compiler Version
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.30;


SPDX-License-Identifier: A standard tag indicating license info.

pragma solidity 0.8.30;: Means the contract uses Solidity version 0.8.30 — ensures compatibility and safety features (like overflow protection).

2. Contract Declaration
contract Bank {


A contract in Solidity is similar to a class in other programming languages.
It defines data (state variables) and functions (methods).

3. State Variables
uint256 private balance;
address public accOwner;


balance: Stores total Ether (ETH) deposited in the contract.

private → cannot be directly read by external contracts.

accOwner: The Ethereum address of the contract owner (public — anyone can read it).

🧩 Concept:
All data on the blockchain is stored permanently — this means even if the contract restarts, the balance remains unless the contract is destroyed.

4. Constructor
constructor() payable {
    accOwner = msg.sender;
    balance = msg.value;
}


The constructor runs once when the contract is deployed.

msg.sender: The address deploying the contract → becomes the account owner.

msg.value: Ether sent during deployment (optional initial deposit).

🪙 payable keyword allows this function to receive Ether.

5. Deposit Function
function deposit() public payable {
    balance += msg.value;
}


public: Anyone can call this function.

payable: Allows the function to receive Ether.

msg.value: Amount of Ether sent with the transaction.

💡 Concept:
When you call this function from MetaMask or Remix and send 1 ETH, the function:

Accepts it

Increases the stored balance

Adds a transaction to the blockchain ledger

6. Withdraw Function
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not the account owner");
    require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount should be greater than 0");
    require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");

    balance -= amount;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}


✅ Logic Flow:

require() checks protect against invalid operations.

Only the owner (accOwner) can withdraw.

Deducts the requested amount from the contract balance.

Sends Ether to the caller using .transfer().

🛡️ Concept:
If someone else (non-owner) tries to withdraw — the transaction fails, and gas is consumed but Ether isn’t lost.

7. Show Balance
function showBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
    require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not the account owner");
    return balance;
}


view: Function doesn’t modify blockchain data (no gas fee for reading).

Returns the current stored balance only to the owner.

8. Fallback & Receive Functions
receive() external payable {
    balance += msg.value;
}

fallback() external payable {
    balance += msg.value;
}


These two functions handle Ether transfers that don’t call any function:

receive() → Triggered when Ether is sent with no data.

fallback() → Triggered when Ether is sent with data or when a function doesn’t exist.

Both increase the balance when Ether is received.

🔗 Step 3: How It Relates to Blockchain
Blockchain Concept	How It Appears Here
Smart Contract	Bank is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and acts as an autonomous program.
Immutability	Once deployed, the code cannot be changed.
Transparency	Anyone can read accOwner and transaction logs.
Security	Ownership checks prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
Ether Storage	The contract can hold and send Ether securely.
Decentralization	No central bank; the blockchain ensures honesty through consensus.
